This bot is about 20mb of storage when compiled in release mode and requires less than 24mb of allocated RAM with moderate usage.

(Note that registration slash commands are currently disabled and the buttons are shown when they are sent in my private channel, so change the channel id for that to work. This channel id is visible in help.rs at the very bottom.)
